## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
The motivation for the Madlibs game is to provide the user with some slight relaxation and fun. We designed a game that targets an audience that wants to explore creativity by playing a madlib game alone, but this game also provides a visually appeasing experience that the user can enjoy as well. We wanted to shy about from boring and add a little fun to an every day routine. The Madlib game we craeted is both fun and creative. It can even be used as an ice breaker in a rather awkard meeting or orientation, maybe even in the classroom! The possibilities are many. It can be a fun little break time exercise to do on your own or to be enjoyed with friends and colleagues.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
This project was built because we wanted to add a twist of freshness and uniqueness to a game that is creative and we wanted to make this fun experience even more appeasing. A madlib has its twists and turns and the story is shaped based on what the user decides for it to be. It is not be taken serious but is rather aimed to be enjoyed while relaxing or for some down time. The options are there for those who want to experiment with words game and have a little but of silly fun.

- What problem does it solve?
The Madlib game aims to provide a dynamic experience. It's purpose lies in entertaining its users and carrying them through a fun journey where word-play and mysterie lead to an unexpected outcome that it is sure to surprise and perhaps even provide some laughter and silly fun. The dynamic usage of the words the user chooses to fill in the categories, is then generated into a story that is shaped based on both the mysterie, and the display of the finished product. This is what makes this game fun. You never know what you are going to get. 

- What did you learn?
During this learning experience it is important to mention how the resources available can make, break, and change a project depending on what is trying to be accomplished. Good organization plays a role in figuring out tasks, responsibilties within and executing functionality. Having a fully functional product is the game's goal, while also inviting the user into a uniqe experience that can be repeated sas many times as they please. Having the right data and the resources that work best to meet the overall objective was key in the making of this Madlib game.
